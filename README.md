## 🎯 **Overview**

This project analyzes **21,465 births** from the **2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)** to identify independent predictors of skilled birth attendance using **multivariable logistic regression** with proper confounding adjustment.

**Why This Matters:**  
Nigeria accounted for approximately 20% of global maternal deaths in 2017 (WHO, 2019). While recent estimates suggest modest progress (WHO, 2023), the country remains among the world's highest-burden settings for maternal mortality. This 2018 analysis remains highly relevant for understanding structural barriers to skilled delivery care and informing targeted interventions.Understanding barriers to skilled delivery care is critical for reducing preventable maternal mortality. This analysis provides evidence-based insights for policy intervention.

**Key Contribution:**  
Unlike descriptive reports, this analysis **controls for confounding** to isolate independent effects, revealing which factors truly drive access to skilled care versus which associations are explained by other variables.

## 🔑 **Key Findings**

| Finding | Statistic | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Overall SBA prevalence** | **44.9%** | Only 4 in 9 Nigerian women deliver with skilled care |
| **Strongest predictor** | Higher education: **aOR = 7.01** (95% CI: 5.68–8.67) | 7× the odds vs no education, after adjustment |
| **Most actionable factor** | ANC ≥4 visits: **aOR = 3.80** (95% CI: 3.51–4.11) | Nearly 4× the odds; modifiable through programs |
| **Wealth gradient** | Richest vs Poorest: **aOR = 6.27** (95% CI: 5.27–7.46) | 6× the odds after controlling for education & residence |
| **Regional inequality** | South West: **85.6%** vs North West: **17.7%** | 68 percentage point gap within one country |
| **Confounding magnitude** | Education crude OR: **64.04** → adjusted: **7.01** | 89% of crude effect was confounding |

### **Policy Implications:**
- **Immediate intervention:** Scale ANC programs (free services, mobile clinics, Community Health Workers (CHWs))
- **Geographic targeting:** Prioritize North West and North East regions
- **Long-term investment:** Girls' education reduces maternal mortality 15-20 years downstream
- **Equity focus:** Address structural wealth barriers to access

## 🌍 **Background & Motivation**

### The Problem
**Maternal mortality in Nigeria:**
- **512 deaths per 100,000 live births** (WHO, 2017) — one of the highest globally
- ~67,000 maternal deaths annually — **19% of global total**
- Most deaths are **preventable** with skilled care during delivery

**Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA):**
- Delivery by doctor, nurse, midwife, or auxiliary midwife
- Reduces risk of complications (hemorrhage, infection, obstructed labor)
- Essential for achieving **SDG 3.1** (reduce maternal mortality to <70 per 100,000 by 2030)

### The Gap
While SBA coverage has increased globally, **Nigeria lags behind**. Understanding the **independent determinants** of SBA access is critical for:
- Designing targeted interventions
- Allocating resources efficiently  
- Monitoring health equity

**This analysis goes beyond descriptive statistics** by using multivariable regression to control for confounding, revealing which factors independently predict SBA after accounting for correlated variables.

## ❓ **Research Questions**

### Primary Question
**What factors independently predict skilled birth attendance among women of reproductive age in Nigeria?**

### Specific Questions
1. What is the prevalence of skilled birth attendance in Nigeria (2018)?
2. Is maternal education associated with SBA after controlling for wealth and residence?
3. Does household wealth influence SBA independently of education?
4. Is urban residence associated with higher odds of SBA after adjustment?
5. Does attending ≥4 ANC visits increase likelihood of skilled delivery?
6. Which factors remain significant predictors in a fully adjusted model?

### Objectives
1. ✅ Determine the prevalence of SBA in Nigeria
2. ✅ Examine crude (unadjusted) associations between sociodemographic factors and SBA
3. ✅ Assess whether ANC utilization predicts SBA after adjustment
4. ✅ Identify independent predictors after controlling for confounders

## 🔬 **Methods**

### Study Design
**Cross-sectional analysis** of secondary data (2018 NDHS)

### Analytic Approach

#### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Loaded Stata file using `pandas.read_stata()`
- Filtered to women with birth in past 5 years (`m3a_1` non-missing)
- Created binary SBA outcome: `SBA = 1` if doctor OR nurse/midwife OR auxiliary midwife present
- Applied DHS sampling weights: `weight = v005 / 1,000,000`
- Recoded predictors:
  - ANC visits → binary (≥4 vs <4)
  - Age → 6 categories (5-year groups)
  - Parity → 4 categories (1, 2–3, 4–5, 6+)
- Excluded 327 women (1.5%) with missing ANC data

#### 2. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Frequency distributions for all categorical variables
- Mean, median, standard deviation for continuous variables (age, parity)
- Stratified SBA prevalence by each predictor

#### 3. **Bivariate Analysis**
- **Chi-square tests** for association between each predictor and SBA
- **Cramér's V** to measure effect size/strength of association
- Significance level: α = 0.05

#### 4. **Multivariable Analysis**
- **Unadjusted logistic regression:** Each predictor modeled individually
- **Adjusted logistic regression:** All predictors entered simultaneously

**Model specification:**
logit(SBA) = β₀ + β₁(Education) + β₂(Wealth) + β₃(Residence) + β₄(Region) + β₅(Age) + β₆(Parity) + β₇(ANC ≥4)

**Interpretation:**
- Exponentiated coefficients (e^β) = **adjusted odds ratios (aOR)**
- aOR > 1 → increased odds of SBA
- aOR < 1 → decreased odds of SBA
- 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated using profile likelihood
- p-values from Wald z-tests

**Model fit:** Pseudo R² = 0.40 indicating strong explanatory power for a behavioral health outcome model.

#### 5. **Confounding Assessment**
- Compared crude (unadjusted) vs adjusted odds ratios
- Calculated percent change: `((aOR - crude OR) / crude OR) × 100`
- Magnitude of confounding assessed by reduction in effect size

### Ethical Considerations
- DHS data is de-identified and publicly available
- Analysis conducted for educational/research purposes
- Findings intended to inform public health policy

### 4. Confounding Assessment

**Crude vs Adjusted Odds Ratios:**

| Variable | Crude OR | Adjusted OR | % Change | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Higher education | 64.04 | 7.01 | **−89.0%** | Massive confounding by wealth & residence |
| Richest wealth | 48.76 | 6.27 | **−87.1%** | Highly confounded by education & urban residence |
| Secondary education | 13.02 | 2.81 | **−78.4%** | Substantial confounding |
| Urban residence | 4.55 | 1.20 | **−73.7%** | Mostly explained by wealth & education |
| ANC ≥4 visits | 8.69 | 3.80 | **−56.3%** | *Least confounded* — direct mechanism |

**Key Insight:** Education and wealth had enormous crude effects (OR > 60), but 87-89% was due to confounding. After adjustment, effects remain strong but more realistic. ANC showed the least confounding, suggesting a more direct causal pathway.

### 3. Main Results — Forest Plot

[Forest Plot of Adjusted Odds Ratios]<img width="1484" height="1183" alt="forest_plot_adjusted_ORs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2639d7f0-4ac4-4a26-b6bc-ffa50ae0ad04" />


**Publication-quality forest plot showing:**
- Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
- Reference line at OR = 1.0 (no effect)
- Higher education: strongest predictor (aOR = 7.01)
- ANC ≥4 visits: most actionable (aOR = 3.80)
- Urban residence: minimal independent effect (aOR = 1.20)
- All confidence intervals exclude 1.0 (all significant)

---

## ⚠️ **Limitations**

### 1. **Cross-Sectional Design**
- Cannot establish causality (only associations)
- Reverse causation possible for some factors

### 2. **Self-Reported Data**
- Recall bias (women report births up to 5 years ago)
- Social desirability bias (may overreport skilled attendance)

### 3. **Unmeasured Confounding**
Variables not in the model but could influence SBA:
- Facility density/distance to health centers
- Quality of care at facilities
- Cultural/religious norms
- Decision-making autonomy
- Previous birth complications

### 4. **Temporal Limitation**
- Data from 2018; may not reflect current situation (2025)
- COVID-19 pandemic may have disrupted health systems post-2020

### 5. **Missing Data**
- 1.5% missing ANC data (handled via complete case analysis)
- Missing completely at random (MCAR) assumed but not tested

### 6. **Generalizability**
- Findings specific to Nigeria
- May not apply to other sub-Saharan African countries with different health system structures
